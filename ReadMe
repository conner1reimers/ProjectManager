Triggers: 


CREATE TRIGGER `change_project` BEFORE UPDATE ON `employees` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
  if old.current_activity != null and old.current_activity != new.current_activity or old.is_clocked_in = 1 and new.is_clocked_in = 0
    then
      insert into employee_activity (start_time, end_time, eid, pid, tid) values (old.clock_in_time, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, old.employee_id, old.current_project, old.current_task);
  end if;
end



CREATE TRIGGER `after_insert_task` AFTER INSERT ON `task_in_project` FOR EACH ROW UPDATE projects p SET p.total_task_count = p.total_task_count+1 
  WHERE p.project_id = new.pid



CREATE TRIGGER `tasks_BEFORE_UPDATE` BEFORE UPDATE ON `tasks` FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
	if new.status = 'complete' and (old.status = 'todo' or old.status = 'inProgress') then
		update projects p set p.completed_task_count = p.completed_task_count+1 where p.project_id = new.pid;
	elseif old.status = 'complete' and (new.status = 'todo' or new.status = 'inProgress') then
		update projects p set p.completed_task_count = p.completed_task_count-1 where p.project_id = new.pid;

these will be inserted as your current task and project to the database

4.) Now, when you clock in on the bottom left part of the screen you will have that information logged once you clock out (trigger)

5.) Once you clock out you can find your employee activity on the main page, on your employee name click the 3 dots and click employee activity

6.) with these 3 dots you can edit employees too, and the same with the 3 dots on departments, tasks, and projects


7.) In employee activity the duration is calculated, the task and project you've been working on are tracked


8.) Inside employee activity, tasks, and "all" projects you can filter the database results based on what you wish
